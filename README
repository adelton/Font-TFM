				Font::TFM
		-----------------------------------------

This is the README file for the Font::TFM package.

This Perl module allows you to read the TeX font metric (TFM) files
and access the information stored in them. You create an object for the
file and its methods then return the values of the font. See the man
page for complete list and usage of the module.

Installation:
	Download the tar.gz, unpack it, change to the Font-TFM-*
	directory. Then do

		perl Makefile.PL
		make
		make test
		make install

	or you can use CPAN module and just type "install Font::TFM".
	
Ideas, bug reports:
	Any comments or bug reports concerning this module can be send
	to my e-mail address. Sending message to clpm is OK but send a
	copy to me since I might miss your post. Please provide as
	much information as possible, including version of Perl and
	this module, and state "Font::TFM" in the Subject. It will
	help me solve the problem faster.
